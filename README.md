# gan-from-scratch

Building multiple VAEs and GAN from scratch. Implementing deterministic, variational, and conditional auto-encoders, tweaking the loss functions. Coding GAN with batch and spectral normalizations.

An independent project created as an assignment for CSCI 566 at the University of Southern California.

Scored 100/100 for grading.

```Problem1_VAE_v0.ipynb``` contains code for VAE, ```Problem2_GAN_v0.ipynb``` contains code for GAN.
